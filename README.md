Here is some of my ([quark\_zju](http://twitter.com/Quark_zju)'s) dotfiles.

About
=====
I use zsh, gvim, ruby, i3, git ....

You may find these dotfiles useful if you use these tools as well.

Any comments are welcome :p

Usage
=====
Just run `update_home.sh` in terminal (`zsh` required).
This script will install dotfiles if they are not existed in `$HOME`,
update older `$HOME` dotfiles, and show file names with difference found.

Notes
=====
fonts
-----
* Install `DroidSans` to display CJK and Thai characters correctly.
* Install `Terminus` as terminal / gvim font. If you do not like bitmap fonts,
  `Dejavu Sans Mono` and `Droid Sans Mono` are good terminal fonts.

gemrc
-----
* Currently `ruby.taobao.org` is in `.gemrc`, you may want to
  change it to `rubygems.org`.
